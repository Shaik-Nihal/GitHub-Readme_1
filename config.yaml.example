# Configuration for the GitHub README Generator

# --- AI Model Settings ---
# Specifies the OpenAI model to use for generation.
# Examples: "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4o", "gpt-4-turbo"
# Ensure the selected model is compatible with your OpenAI API key and access level.
ai_model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Controls the creativity of the AI. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) are more creative,
# lower values (e.g., 0.2) are more deterministic/focused.
# Must be between 0.0 and 2.0.
ai_temperature: 0.7

# Maximum number of tokens (roughly words/sub-words) the AI can generate in its response.
# This helps control the length and cost of the generation.
# Different models have different maximum token limits for prompt + completion.
ai_max_tokens: 2048


# --- Prompt Construction Settings ---
max_prompt_files: 15               # Max number of files to detail in the prompt
max_content_snippet_length: 600    # Max character length for content snippets from each file

# Repository Content Fetching Exclusions
# These extend the built-in exclusions.
# Use glob patterns (though current implementation might be direct string match - check script).
excluded_dirs:
  - "docs/"          # Example: exclude a documentation directory if it's not relevant for the AI
  - "examples/"
  - "tests/"         # Exclude test directories if they are too verbose for the prompt
  - "test/"
  - "data/"          # Exclude data directories
  - "samples/"
  # - "**/__pycache__/" # Already handled by default
  # - "**/node_modules/" # Already handled by default

excluded_files:
  - "*.log"          # Example: exclude all log files
  - "*.tmp"
  - "*.swp"
  - ".DS_Store"      # Already handled by default (but good to show example)
  - "specific_large_data_file.csv"
  # - "LICENSE"      # You might want toexclude this if you only want the AI to state type, not see content

# README Sections Configuration
# Defines the sections the AI will be asked to generate and their order.
# You can add, remove, or reorder these.
# The AI will be instructed to generate content for these headings.
# Placeholders like "(Placeholder)" suggest areas for manual completion.
